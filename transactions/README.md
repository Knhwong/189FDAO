This is a small sample of connecting a webpage to metamask to access a user's account.
So far, it detects whether Metamask is installed and allows a user to connect their

Skeleton functions for interacting with the voting contract have been written, but
have not been tested. The contract needs to be compiled and deployed to a test
network to be able to test it in the code.

To run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
